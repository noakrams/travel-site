This was a 2 week long project built during course I took on Udemy website.
The result is a mobile-first responsive, Fictitious tourist website.
Used the Netlify service to not only host the website but also to learn the very basics of cloud (or AWS Lambda) functions.
### Project goals included using technologies such as:
* Git
* GitHub
* Node.js 
* NPM
* Object-oriented
* JavaScript
* ES6
* webpack
* Netlify
* BEM
